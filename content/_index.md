Software engineer with a preference for simplicity. I enjoy creating modular software.

In my spare time I like to experiment with Arduino and 3D printing.

### Some things I've been working on:
- [Redox](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) Keyboard Build using [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
- [NorthPaw](https://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/) Clone
- Customizable [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/PRDeltoid/ArduinoTimerProject)
- Home lab and self-hosting using Docker and [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
- Learning parametric CAD using Fusion 360
- Modding my [Ender 3 V2](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-v2-3d-printer-csco)
- Learning how to use a sewing machine

### Some technologies I'm excited about:
- C# and .NET
- Containerization and [Dev Environments](https://containers.dev/) with Docker
- Open-source software (notably [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and single-file databases
- Personal Knowledgebase Software like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

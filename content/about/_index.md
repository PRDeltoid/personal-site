Software engineer with a preference for minimalism and simplicity. I enjoy creating modular software.

In my spare time I like to experiment with Arduino development, hobby electronics, and 3D printing.

### Some things I've been working on:
- Redox Keyboard Build
- NorthClaw Clone
- Pomodoro Timer
- Home lab and self-hosting using Docker and Portainer
- Learning parametric design using Fusion 360
- Modding my Ender 3 v2
- Learning how to use a sewing machine

### Some technologies I'm excited about:
- C# and .NET
- Containerization and Dev Environments with Docker
- Dependency injection and inversion of control
- Open-source software (notably Debian Linux)
- SQLite and single-file databases
